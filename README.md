# 混淆电路

==本项目为 ShanghaiTech CS252密码学课程项目==

Implement the garbled circuit based protocol for computing the function GE(a, b). The implementation should contain
* a procedure that takes GE(a, b) as input and outputs a garbled circuit of GE(a, b); 
* a procedure that takes a garbled circuit of GE(a, b) and a set of input labels as input, evaluates the garbled circuit, and produces an output label.
